# n8n community node

## Overview
This is a project containing code for an n8n community node. n8n is a workflow
automation platform where users build workflows with nodes, which are the
building block of a workflow. Nodes can perform a range of actions, such as
starting a workflow (called a "trigger node"), fetching and sending data, or
processing and manipulating it. Besides that there are credentials - entities
that store sensitive information on how to connect to external services and
APIs. A node can require some credentials to be used. Community nodes are a way
for anyone to create such nodes and add them to be used in n8n. All community
nodes are named in a format: `n8n-nodes-<n>` or `@org/n8n-nodes-<n>`.
Community nodes can also be submitted for approval to be used on n8n Cloud
version. In that case there are rules that the node needs to follow in order to
be approved

## Important notes
- Follow the **rules and guidelines in this document and the linked docs
  below** over any code examples.
- All code blocks in these docs are **illustrative and incomplete**.
  They **MUST NOT** be copied verbatim or assumed to be the final desired code.
- Replace example names like `Example`, `Wordpress`, `wordpressApi`, etc.
  with names that match the **actual service / node** you are building.
- When in doubt, **generalize from the patterns**, don't replicate the exact
  structure, fields, or values from the examples.
- Produce the **full implementation** needed for the current project
  (nodes, credentials, tests, etc.), not just fragments similar to examples.
- If an example omits parts (e.g. types, operations, properties), **infer and
  implement the missing parts** based on the real requirements / API docs.
- Never output `Wordpress`-specific code unless the project is actually about
  WordPress.

## Project structure
There are two main folders in this project:
- `nodes` contains all of the nodes in a package (there can be more than 1).
  The code for each node usually lives in its own folder
- `credentials` contains all of the credentials in a package. Usually it's just
  a single file for every credential
So it looks something like this:
.
├── nodes/
│   └── Example/
│       ├── Example.node.ts
│       └── ...
├── credentials/
│   └── Example.credentials.ts
├── package.json
└── ...
It's important to note that `package.json` has a special field `n8n` that have
information about nodes and credentials in a package:
```json
{
  "name": "n8n-nodes-example",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "n8n": {
    "n8nNodesApiVersion": 1,
    "strict": true,
    "credentials": [
        "dist/credentials/Example.credentials.js"
    ],
    "nodes": [
      "dist/nodes/Example/Example.node.js"
    ]
  }
}
```
`nodes` and `credentials` keys contain paths to transpiled JS files in a `dist`
folder for the nodes and credentials respectively. If you add/remove/rename
nodes and/or credentials, you need to make sure to update `n8n.nodes` and
`n8n.credentials` keys in `package.json` accordingly. Initial files in the
project _may_ contain example nodes and/or credentials that need to be
**removed or renamed** once you start making an actual node.

## Key guidelines
- Use the `n8n-node` CLI tool **whenever possible** for building, dev mode,
  linting, etc.
- **Always** address any lint/typecheck errors/warnings, unless there is a
  **very specific reason** to ignore/disable it
- Make sure to use **proper types whenever possible**
- If you are updating the npm package version, make sure to **update
  CHANGELOG.md** in the root of the repository
- Read `.agents/workflow.md` for more info

## Working with other people's branches

More than one person contributes here, and more than one of them works with an
agent. **Branches are owned.** Treat a branch you did not create as read-only,
whoever or whatever created it.

**Do not, without an explicit instruction from the maintainer in this session:**

- `git push` — forced or not — to a branch you did not create. Rebasing
  someone's unmerged commit rewrites its committer and breaks their `git pull`.
- Merge a pull request you did not open, whether by `gh pr merge`, the API, or
  the UI.
- `git rebase`, `git commit --amend` or `git reset` on a branch with an open
  pull request opened by someone else.
- Push to `main`. Everything lands through a pull request.

**gate — check who owns the branch before any push:**

```bash
gh pr view --json author,headRefName    # whose PR is this?
git log -1 --format='%an <%ae>' HEAD    # who wrote the tip?
```

If either answers with someone else, stop.

**What to do instead.** If you have a change that belongs on someone else's
branch:

1. Branch from theirs, push to your own branch, and open a pull request
   targeting *their* branch. GitHub supports PRs between branches.
2. Or leave the diff as a review comment or a GitHub suggested change.
3. Or say the work is ready and ask the maintainer to relay it.

Do not decide the change is small enough to skip this. The size of the diff is
not the problem; the branch owner losing the ability to pull is, and they did
not agree to the rewrite.

**Why this is written down even though it will not hold.** Instructions that
ask an agent to *stop* and hand off are the ones agents comply with least —
measured at close to zero, even when the agent is told it has just violated
one. So this section is a statement of intent for humans, not a control. The
controls are GitHub rulesets on the repository. If you are an agent reading
this: the rules above are still the rules.
